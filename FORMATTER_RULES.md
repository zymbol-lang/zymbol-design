# Zymbol Formatter Rules (`zymbol fmt`)

> **Design principle** — `zymbol fmt` is a *layout tool*, not a code
> transformer. It adjusts whitespace, indentation, and brace placement. It
> never alters the meaning of a program — and since the safety-gate rework
> this is **enforced mechanically**, not just promised.

## 1. What the formatter IS and IS NOT

| IS | IS NOT |
|----|--------|
| A whitespace normalizer | A linter or code analyzer |
| An indentation enforcer | An expression transformer |
| A brace/block layout tool | A parenthesis adder or remover |
| A comment and blank-line preserver | An optimizer or simplifier |

**Analogy with `rustfmt`:** `rustfmt` enforces a single canonical style —
indentation, spacing, brace placement — but never changes the semantics of any
expression. `zymbol fmt` follows the same contract, with one addition: a
built-in safety gate refuses to emit output that is not equivalent to the
input (see §2.4).

---

## 2. Fundamental constraints

### 2.1 The token contract

The formatted output must lex to **exactly the same significant token
sequence** as the source. "Significant" excludes only:

- comments (`//`, `/* */`) — preserved separately, see §9
- `;` statement separators — `a; b` is reprinted as two lines
- physical line breaks — layout is the formatter's job

Everything else is untouchable. In particular:

- **User parentheses are always preserved.** The parser keeps them in the AST
  (`Expr::Group`), so `(a + b)`, `(x -> x * 2)`, `m[(i)>(j)]`, `(f)(x)` all
  reprint exactly as written.
- **The formatter never inserts parentheses** into code that parsed without
  them.
- Surface sugar reprints as written: `x += 1`, `x++`, `x--`, `arr[i] = v`,
  `arr[i] += v` (recorded by the parser as `AssignSugar`), hot-def markers
  `x°` / `°x`, mutable params `name~`, input typespecs (`##.(5,2)`, `###(n)`,
  `##"`, `##'`, `#|var|`), interpolated strings `"a {b} c"`, `¶` vs `\\`,
  1-tuples `(1,)`, single vs double bracket extraction (`arr[i>a..b]` vs
  `arr[[path]]`), and export-block comma separators.
- **Literals reprint as written.** A literal reaches the AST as a *value*, and
  many source forms share one value: `४२`, `0x2A`, `0b101010` and `42` are all
  `Int(42)`; `٣٫٥` and `3.5` are one `Float`; `#१` and `#1` are one `Bool`.
  The formatter emits the literal's own source text, recovered from its span and
  verified by re-lexing it (`visitor.rs::literal_source_form`) — so a script, a
  base prefix, an exponent, and written leading or trailing zeros all survive.

  > Until v0.0.9 it printed the *value*, so `४२` came out `42` and a program
  > written entirely in Devanagari stopped being one the moment it was
  > formatted. `0o17` came out as a quoted **U+000F**: the value is a `Char`, so
  > the formatter wrote a raw control character into the source. None of P1–P4
  > can see this — the output reparses, is idempotent, runs identically and
  > keeps every comment — and G1 passes legitimately, because `Integer(42)` is
  > `Integer(42)` whichever script spelled it. Held by unit tests in
  > `crates/zymbol-formatter/src/lib.rs`, which is where a surface property has
  > to be checked.

### 2.2 Never delete content

Every `//` and `/* */` comment in the source appears in the output (G4 in the
safety gate enforces the count). Blank lines between statements are preserved:
a gap of one or more blank lines in the source becomes exactly one blank line.

### 2.3 Idempotency

`zymbol fmt` twice produces the same output as once. The property test suite
(`tests/scripts/fmt_property.sh`, property P2) enforces this over the whole
corpus.

### 2.4 The safety gate (fail closed)

After producing output, the formatter verifies — inside
`crates/zymbol-formatter/src/gate.rs` — that:

- **G1**: the significant token stream is unchanged (§2.1),
- **G2**: the output still parses,
- **G3**: the statement tree has the same pre-order shape,
- **G4**: the comment count is unchanged.

On any mismatch `zymbol fmt` returns an error naming the first divergent
token and **leaves the file untouched**. A formatter bug can therefore refuse
to format a file, but it can never corrupt one.

## 3. Indentation

| Rule | Value |
|------|-------|
| Unit | 4 spaces (configurable via `--indent`) |
| Tabs vs spaces | Spaces by default; tabs via config |
| Level increase | Every block `{ }` opens a new level |
| Level decrease | Closing `}` returns to previous level |

The `}` that closes a block sits at the same indentation level as the
statement that opened it.

---

## 4. Spacing rules

### 4.1 Around assignment operators
One space before and after `=`, `:=`, `+=`, `-=`, `*=`, `/=`, `%=`, `^=`.

### 4.2 Around arithmetic and comparison operators
One space before and after `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`, `==`, `<>`, `<`, `>`,
`<=`, `>=`, `&&`, `||`.

> Note: Zymbol's not-equal operator is `<>`. The lexer intentionally rejects
> `!=` with a hint to use `<>`.

### 4.3 Range operator — **no spaces** around `..` (`1..10`, `arr$[2..5]`)

### 4.4 Symbol operators attach to their left operand
`$#`, `$+`, `$-`, `$--`, `$?`, `$??`, `$>`, `$|`, `$<`, `$^`, `$~~`, `$[`,
`$++`, `$~`: no space before (`arr$#`). Exception: `$+` keeps a space after
it (`result $+ element`).

### 4.5 `::` — no spaces (`module::function()`)

### 4.6 Tuple field access `.` — no spaces (`point.x`)

### 4.7 Lambda arrow `->` — one space each side

Exactly one, whichever the body is:

```zymbol
e = x -> x + 1          // expression body
b = (x) -> { <~ x }     // block body
t = () -> { <~ 42 }     // zero parameters (v0.0.9)
```

The right-hand space belongs to whoever writes it once. A block supplies its
own leading space (§5.1), so the arrow does not add one there; an expression
has none, so the arrow does. Until v0.0.9 the arrow always wrote it and every
block lambda came out `x ->  { … }` with two — invisible to the property
harness, which checks reparse, idempotence, semantics and comments, and a
stray space breaks none of the four. Fixed by
`crates/zymbol-formatter/src/visitor.rs::format_lambda`, held by three unit
tests including one for trailing whitespace in brace-next-line mode.

### 4.8 Pipe `|>` — one space each side

### 4.9 Concatenation `$++` — one space before

### 4.10 Output statement `>>`
One space after `>>`, one space between items. The `¶` (or `\\`) token joins
the preceding token on the same line — unless that line ends in a trailing
`//` comment, in which case the `¶` keeps its own line. Chained outputs
written on one source line (`>> a >> b ¶`) stay on one line.

---

## 5. Block and brace layout

### 5.1 Opening brace — always on the same line as the construct
### 5.2 `_` (else) and `_?` (else-if) — on the same line as the preceding `}`

### 5.3 Blank lines
One blank line is inserted before and after every top-level function
declaration. Source blank-line gaps elsewhere are preserved as exactly one
blank line (runs collapse).

### 5.4 Single-statement blocks (inline option)
With `inline_single_statement = true` (default), a block holding exactly one
*simple* statement (assignment, output, break, continue, return, expression)
may collapse to one line: `? found { @! }`. A block that contains a comment
never collapses — the comment needs a line of its own.

---

## 6. Match expressions (`??`)
Each arm is one line. Arms are not column-aligned.

## 7. Module files (`# name { }`)
Header, imports, and export block follow normal indentation rules. The export
block reprints the user's optional `,` separators, and a single-line export
block (`#> { add, PI }`) stays on one line.

## 8. Labeled loops
Canonical form `@:label`, `@:label!`, `@:label>`.

---

## 9. Comments

Comments are re-emitted by **source position** (span interleaving): the
formatter walks the AST in source order and inserts each comment before the
first statement that follows it, or at the end of the line it trails. The old
line-matching merge pass is gone — comment placement can no longer duplicate
or reorder code.

### 9.1 Trailing line comments
Stay on their line, separated by one space; alignment padding collapses to
one space.

### 9.2 Standalone line comments
Keep their own line and are re-indented to the surrounding block level.

### 9.3 Block comments
Preserved in full. Continuation lines lose the opening line's original
indentation and inherit the current block indentation, so the whole comment
moves together.

### 9.4 Known limitation
A comment in the middle of a multi-line *expression* migrates to the nearest
statement boundary. It is never lost (G4), but it can move.

---

## 10. Known normalizations

These are the only intentional differences between input and output, besides
whitespace:

| Normalization | Example |
|---------------|---------|
| `;`-separated statements split to lines | `a = 1; b = 2` → two lines |
| Blank-line runs collapse to one | `\n\n\n` → `\n\n` |
| Comment alignment padding collapses | `x = 5    // c` → `x = 5 // c` |
| Blank line added around top-level functions | §5.3 |
| `¶` join to the previous output line | §4.10 |

If `fmt` changes anything not in this table, it is a bug — and the safety
gate will normally have refused to emit it.

**"Normally" is the load-bearing word.** The gate compares *tokens*, so a
rewrite that preserves the token stream passes it: printing `42` for `४२` is
one, and it stood for four releases. When output differs from input in a way
this table does not list, the gate's silence is not evidence.

### 10.1 The table is executable

This section is prose, and prose does not fail a build. The machine-readable
copy is **`ZyFmtCheck/normalizations.toml`**, and `ZyFmtCheck/bin/zyfmtcheck`
reads that and nothing else:

1. **format** every `.zy` of a body in a *temporary copy* — never in place;
2. **verify** that the code skeleton and the multiset of comments are unchanged,
   and that every remaining difference is one the file declares;
3. **run** the application's own suite from the copy and require the same output.

It runs over the **LDV applications** rather than only the corpus, because a
formatter's damage lives in what short files do not have: deep nesting,
hand-aligned tables, comments in awkward places, five writing systems, modules
importing each other. `--body corpus` asks the wider, shallower question.

The point is not the check, it is where the list lives. Adding a normalization
means adding an entry with a reason, in a file a reviewer reads — so a
formatter cannot grow a new power quietly. §13's non-goals are a promise; this
is the mechanism.

It is a **separate project**, not a test in this repository, and that is
deliberate: a contract that lives inside the thing it constrains is not a
contract. `zyq suite` gates on it.
