# Zymbol Memory Model — Design vs. Implementation Audit

> **Version audited: v0.0.7 — 2026-07-12. Fully resolved in v0.0.8** (branch

## 1. Physical Memory Layout

The tree-walker holds all program state inside the `Interpreter` struct
(`crates/zymbol-interpreter/src/lib.rs:327`):

| Structure | Role |
|---|---|
| `scope_stack: Vec<HashMap<String, Value>>` | Lexical scopes. Index 0 = global (or function-frame bottom). One map pushed per block. |
| `mutable_vars_stack` / `const_vars_stack` | Parallel stacks tracking `~` params and `:=` constants per scope. |
| `loop_scope_depths: Vec<usize>` | Indices into `scope_stack` where `@` loop-anchor scopes start (used by `x°` / `°x`). |
| `functions: HashMap<String, Rc<FunctionDef>>` | Named function table. **Not scoped** — a definition executed anywhere registers globally. |
| `loaded_modules: HashMap<PathBuf, LoadedModule>` | One entry per module file path. Holds persistent module state. |
| `import_aliases: HashMap<String, PathBuf>` | Alias → module path. Call-scoped (saved/restored per call). |
| `dead_variables: HashSet<String>` | Names destroyed by `\` (use-after-destruction detection). **Global, not call-scoped** — see MM-3. |

Values have **value semantics**: assignment, argument passing, and capture give the
callee a copy. There are no references or aliasing at the language level; the only
shared-identity structure is `LoadedModule`.

**How that copy is paid for is not part of the semantics.** Since v0.0.9 the three
aggregates are `Rc<Vec<…>>` and are **copied when written, not when passed**:
binding one to a name, handing it to a function or returning it shares the
allocation, and the first writer calls `Rc::make_mut`, which clones only if
somebody else is still holding it. Sharing is invisible precisely because every
write detaches first — the 14-case battery in zy-GO's HLZ-014 checks each door
(reassign the parameter, `$~` inside the callee, `b = a` then write, an array
inside an array, `~` and `<~` marks, the dictionary in both spellings) and the
three engines answer alike. This is the register VM's model, ported; the browser
engine reaches the same place by sharing the JavaScript array and rebuilding it
on write.

`String` is deliberately not shared this way in the tree-walker: a string clone
is one allocation, not one per element, and the VM's `ZyStr` is unsafe code that
earns its keep in a bytecode loop and not here.

Performance machinery that is *semantically neutral* (verified): copy-on-write for
the aggregates (HLZ-012/HLZ-014), scope-map pooling (B10/B13), scope elision for
blocks that declare no variables (QW7 in `if_stmt.rs:16`, QW16 in `loops.rs:36`),
self-assign fast paths (B3/B12), and move-on-return (MoveOrClone).

---

## 2. Global Memory

**Design** (GUIDE §4): the top-level scope holds regular variables, constants, and
function definitions. Regular variables follow lexical scoping — visible and writable
from any inner block.

**Implementation**: `scope_stack[0]` of the root interpreter. Reads walk innermost →
outermost (`get_variable`, `lib.rs:477`); writes update the nearest scope that already
holds the name, otherwise create it in the **innermost** scope (`set_variable`,
`lib.rs:531`).

**Verified**: matches design. Two consequences worth stating explicitly (implicit in the
GUIDE, now explicit here):

- **There is no shadowing.** Assigning to an outer name from an inner block always
  mutates the outer variable; it never creates an inner copy.
- Global variables are **not** visible inside directly-called named functions
  (see §4) — global memory is only "global" for block-structured code, not across
  function-call frames. Constants are the exception (§5).

---

## 3. Block Scopes

**Design** (GUIDE §4 "Variable Scope"): a variable declared inside a block (`? {}`,
`_? {}`, `_ {}`, `@ {}`, `?? {}` arms, `!? {}`) dies when the block ends. Outer
variables are readable and writable from inner blocks. `_name` variables have exact
block scope (no access from inner, outer, or sibling blocks — semantic error). `\ var`
destroys a variable early; reassignment resurrects it.

**Implementation**:

- `execute_block` pushes/pops one scope map (`lib.rs:1138`). QW7/QW16 skip the
  push when the block's top-level statements declare no new variable — semantically
  neutral because in that case every write resolves to an outer scope anyway.
- `@` loops additionally push a persistent **loop-anchor scope** for the whole loop
  (`push_loop_scope`, `lib.rs:441`); the body gets a fresh scope per iteration only if
  it introduces new names (QW16).
- The loop iterator variable is bound with `set_variable`: it lands in the loop-anchor
  scope **unless a variable with the same name already exists outside**, in which case
  the outer variable is reused and keeps the final iteration value after the loop
  (MM-6).
- `_name` rules are enforced by `zymbol-semantic` at analysis time (verified: exact
  error `cannot access underscore variable '_x' from inner scope`).
- `\ var` removes the name from all scopes of the *current frame* and records it in
  `dead_variables` (`destroy_variable`, `lib.rs:808`). Reassignment removes the dead
  mark (resurrect — verified).

**Verified**: matches design, with two footnotes — MM-6 (iterator reuse) and MM-3
(`dead_variables` leaks across call frames, §4).

---

## 4. Function Memory

**Design** (GUIDE §9 "Function Scope", §10b "Named Functions vs Lambdas"):

- Direct call `fn(args)`: fully isolated scope; only parameters are visible; cannot
  read or write outer variables.
- Used as a value (`f = fn`): captures a by-value snapshot of the referenced outer
  variables at the point of **assignment** (asymmetric capture).

**Implementation**: a direct call runs `take_call_state` (`lib.rs:619`), which swaps out
the entire `scope_stack` / `mutable_vars_stack` / `const_vars_stack` / `import_aliases`
and installs a single fresh scope holding the parameters. `restore_call_state`
(`lib.rs:645`) puts everything back on every exit path, including errors (the v0.0.7
L16 fix). `f = fn` goes through `func_def_to_value` (`functions_lambda.rs:239`), which
collects free identifiers in the body and snapshots them from the current scope stack —
same mechanism as lambda capture.

**Verified**: isolation, snapshot-at-assignment, output-param write-back (`<~` params),
recursion, and TCO all behave as documented. **However, the isolation is not total** —
three states cross the call boundary when the design says nothing should:

- **Constants `:=` are injected into every direct-call frame** — intentional
  ("constants are globally scoped by design", `functions_lambda.rs:360-371`) but
  undocumented in the GUIDE (MM-5, doc gap) and broken beyond call depth 1 in the
  tree-walker (MM-9). See §5.
- **`loop_scope_depths` is *not* saved by `take_call_state`.** A function called from
  inside a `@` loop inherits the caller's loop-anchor indices, which point into a
  scope stack that no longer exists. Any `x°` / `°x` use inside that function
  **panics the interpreter** (`index out of bounds`, `lib.rs:456` / `lib.rs:468`).
  The VM executes the same program without crashing → engine divergence (MM-1, bug).

  ```zymbol
  f() { x° *= 7  <~ x }
  @ i:1..2 { >> f() ¶ }    // TW: panic — VM: prints 7, 7
  ```

- **`dead_variables` is not saved by `take_call_state`.** `\ x` inside a function
  marks the *name* `x` dead globally; after the call returns, the caller's own `x`
  raises `use after destruction` even though it was never destroyed (MM-3, bug).
  The VM is unaffected → engine divergence.

  ```zymbol
  kill() { x = 5  \ x  <~ 1 }
  x = 10
  r = kill()
  >> x ¶    // TW: runtime error "use after destruction" — VM: 10
  ```

> **v0.0.8**: both leaks are fixed — `loop_scope_depths` (MM-1) and
> `dead_variables` (MM-3) are saved and restored per call frame in
> `SavedCallState`. Both examples above now print the VM result in both engines.
> Regression tests: `zyquality/corpus/bugs/bug_mm1_hot_def_fn_scope.zy`,
> `zyquality/corpus/bugs/bug_mm3_destroy_frame_local.zy`.

---

## 5. Constant Memory

**Design** (GUIDE §4): `NAME := value` declares an immutable binding; reassignment is
an error. The GUIDE does not specify constant *scope*.

**Implementation**:

- Declaration stores the value like a normal variable and marks the name in the
  current scope's `const_vars_stack` entry (`variables.rs:247`). Redeclaration in any
  visible scope → runtime error `constant 'C' already declared`.
- Reassignment is blocked twice: statically by `zymbol-semantic` (also inside function
  bodies) and at runtime by `is_const` (`lib.rs:549`).
- **Scope**: a constant declared inside a block dies with the block (verified — same
  lexical rule as variables).
- **Cross-frame visibility (design intent)**: `:=` constants declared at the top level
  are meant to behave as **globals that pierce function isolation**. Three independent
  sources agree on this intent: the injection code's comment ("constants are globally
  scoped by design — nested call chains propagate constants correctly",
  `functions_lambda.rs:360-364`), the semantic analyzer (accepts top-level constants
  referenced in any function body), and the VM (resolves them at any call depth).
  This contradicts the GUIDE's "only their parameters are in scope" (MM-5 — GUIDE
  needs an explicit note). Function-local `:=` declarations are local only (the
  semantic analyzer rejects references from other functions — verified).
- **Tree-walker implementation falls one level short (MM-9, bug).** On a direct call,
  constants from the caller's saved stack are copied into the callee's fresh frame
  (`functions_lambda.rs:365-371`) — but the copies are **not re-marked** in the
  callee's `const_vars_stack`. When that callee calls another function, the injection
  loop finds no marked constants to forward, so the constant vanishes at call depth
  ≥ 2. The semantic layer accepted the program, so this surfaces as a *runtime* error
  in TW only; the VM returns the correct value:

  ```zymbol
  K := 5
  inner() { <~ K * 2 }
  outer() { <~ inner() + K }
  >> outer() ¶    // designed: 15 — VM: 15 ✅ — TW: runtime error "'K' is undefined"
  ```

  Corollary: any recursive function or helper chain that reads a global constant
  breaks in the tree-walker. Workaround: pass the constant as a parameter.
- The unmarked injected copies also mean runtime `is_const` does not protect them
  inside function bodies; immutability there rests on the semantic layer, **which does
  not run on modules loaded at runtime** — see MM-4 in §7.

> **v0.0.8**: MM-9 fixed. Root-scope `:=` constants are recorded in a
> `global_consts` table on the interpreter that is **not** swapped by
> `take_call_state`: `get_variable` falls back to it (script frames only —
> module frames keep their isolation), and `is_const` consults it, so top-level
> constants are visible and immutable at any call depth, through recursion and
> lambda frames. Block-local constants remain lexically scoped and are still
> forwarded one frame at a time — now re-marked (`mark_const`) so chains work.
> A parameter may shadow a forwarded constant (`unmark_const` at binding).
> Regression test: `zyquality/corpus/bugs/bug_mm9_const_call_depth.zy`.

```zymbol
PI := 3.14
area(r) { <~ r * r * PI }   // works: PI injected into the isolated frame
>> area(2) ¶                 // → 12.56  (TW and VM agree — call depth 1)
```

## 6. Module Memory

**Design** (GUIDE §17): a module has exported constants (`:=`, read via `alias.CONST`),
private mutable state (`=` variables, persisting across calls, reachable only through
exported functions), and functions. Initializers must be literals (E013) — which
since v0.0.9 includes the three collection literals, recursively, so a lookup table
is module state like any scalar (REFERENCE L41).

**Implementation** (`modules.rs`, `LoadedModule` at `modules.rs:21`):

- At import, the module file is **lexed and parsed only** — the semantic analyzer is
  *not* run on runtime-loaded modules (`load_module`, `modules.rs:120`). E013 is
  enforced by the parser, so structural rules hold, but semantic-only checks (constant
  reassignment, `_name` rules, unused warnings) are silently skipped (root cause of
  MM-4).
- The module body executes once in a private interpreter; its final state is captured
  into a `LoadedModule`:
  - `constants` — exported `:=` values, **snapshot copied at load time**;
  - `all_variables` — every module-level binding (constants + private `=` state);
  - `functions` / `all_functions` — exported vs. complete function tables;
  - `import_aliases` — the module's own imports.
- One `LoadedModule` per resolved file path. **Two aliases to the same file share the
  same state** (verified: increments through alias `a` are visible through alias `b`).
  `std/*` modules are singletons under synthetic `__stdlib__/…` keys.
- **State persistence** works by *inject + write-back*: an `alias::fn()` call injects
  `all_variables` into the fresh frame before the body runs
  (`functions_lambda.rs:347`), and after the body finishes, every key that existed in
  `all_variables` at load time is copied back from the frame
  (`functions_lambda.rs:465-488`). Function locals/params are excluded automatically
  because they were never in `all_variables`.

**Verified**: the documented counter pattern (`c::increment()` / `c::get_value()`)
works in both engines; exported-constant reads (`alias.CONST`) work (L3 fixed);
private variables are inaccessible from outside. Divergences: MM-2 and MM-4 (§7).

---

## 7. Memory of Functions Inside Modules

**Design** (GUIDE §17): module functions see the module's constants and private state;
private helpers are callable from other functions in the same module (BUG-01 fix);
state mutations persist across calls.

**Implementation**: two distinct call paths with **different memory semantics**:

1. **External call `alias::fn(args)`** (`module_info = Some`): injects
   `all_variables`, swaps in the module's `all_functions` table and `import_aliases`,
   executes, then **writes back** module keys. State persists. ✅
2. **Intra-module call `helper(args)`** (bare name, `module_info = None`): the
   callee's frame *does* get the module's `all_variables` injected (via
   `origin_module_path`, `functions_lambda.rs:377-383`), so it can **read** module
   state — but the **write-back step is skipped** (it is gated on `module_info`,
   `functions_lambda.rs:471`). Any mutation of module state inside a helper is
   **silently lost**, and the outer exported function then writes its own stale copy
   back (MM-2, bug).

```zymbol
# counter {
    #> { get_value, bump_via_helper }
    count = 0
    do_bump()          { count = count + 10 }
    bump_via_helper()  { do_bump() }
    get_value()        { <~ count }
}
```

> **MM-12 (v0.0.9).** Reading module state through a helper that does not *name*
> it used to see the value from before the current frame's write. Injection only
> copies the names a body mentions, and a frame's writes only reached the store

> _medio()  { _lee() }                          // does not name `v`
> _lee()    { >> v ¶ }
> ```
>
> A same-module call now publishes the caller's changed keys to the store on the

```zymbol
<# ./counter => c
c::bump_via_helper()
>> c::get_value() ¶    // designed: 10 — TW: 0 (mutation lost) — VM: 10 ✅
```

> **v0.0.8**: MM-2 fixed. Write-back now runs for **every** module frame
> (`module_ctx_path` covers both call paths) and is **diff-based** — only keys
> whose value changed relative to the injected snapshot are persisted, so an

> `zyquality/corpus/bugs/bug_mm2_module_state_helper.zy`.

**Rule of thumb until fixed** *(obsolete since v0.0.8, kept for history)*: mutate
module state only in the function that is called directly through `alias::`;
helpers may read state and must return values instead of mutating.

Additionally, because runtime-loaded modules skip semantic analysis (§6), a module
function **can reassign a module constant** at runtime in the tree-walker. The mutation
persists in `all_variables` (visible to subsequent `alias::` calls) while the exported
`constants` snapshot keeps the original value — a split-brain state (MM-4):

```zymbol
# modconst {
    #> { MAX, get_max, set_evil }
    MAX := 100
    get_max()  { <~ MAX }
    set_evil() { MAX = 5 }
}
```
```zymbol
<# ./modconst => m
>> m.MAX ¶           // → 100
m::set_evil()        // designed: error — TW: silently succeeds
>> m::get_max() ¶    // TW: 5 — VM: 100
>> m.MAX ¶           // → 100 (stale snapshot; now inconsistent with get_max in TW)
```

**Mitigation**: `zymbol check <module>.zy` *does* run the semantic analyzer on the file
directly and catches the reassignment. Run `check` on every module file in CI.

> **v0.0.8**: MM-4 fixed. Importing a module now runs the full semantic gate
> (`VariableAnalyzer` + `TypeChecker`) in **both** engines — the tree-walker's
> `load_module` and the VM compiler's `compile_import` — with identical error
> text. The example above fails at import time. As a runtime backstop, module
> constant names (`LoadedModule.const_names`) are re-marked `const` when
> injected into module frames, so reassignment errors even if analysis is
> bypassed. Regression test: `zyquality/corpus/bugs/bug_mm4_module_const_guard.zy`.

---

## 8. Lambdas and Captures

**Design** (GUIDE §10/10b): capture by value at creation, only referenced variables;
writes to captured variables stay local; per-iteration snapshots in loops.

**Implementation**: `eval_lambda` (`functions_lambda.rs:19`) collects free identifiers
and snapshots them via `capture_only`. Calls run in an isolated frame (`take_call_state`)
seeded with the captures, then params. A no-capture expression lambda takes a fast path
(plain `push_scope`) — safe because expression bodies cannot contain assignments.

**Verified**: all documented capture semantics hold (snapshot, write-locality,
per-iteration capture, left-to-right argument evaluation). Constants are *not*
specially injected into lambda frames — a lambda sees a constant only by capturing it,
which works transparently since capture reads any visible scope.

## 11. Automatic Destruction at Last Use (auto-free, v0.0.8)

The audit found the last-use destruction design half-built and disconnected
(the old `DefUseAnalyzer` → `set_destruction_schedule` pipeline had no caller).
v0.0.8 replaces it with a live implementation, **always on in both engines**,
under one governing invariant: *a correct program can never observe it* — it
only lowers peak memory.

**Design decisions** (validated with the language owner): full scope
(top-level + function bodies), invisible semantics with a distinctive internal
error on analyzer bugs, both engines, always active.

### The analysis — `zymbol_semantic::last_use`

- **Region model**: a region is a flat statement sequence executed once, top
  to bottom — the top-level program or a named function body. All repetition
  (`@`) and branching (`?`, `??`, `!?`) live *inside* single region-level
  statements, so destroying after the last-mentioning statement is temporally
  after every possible use inside it. Nested blocks are not separate regions:
  their locals already die at block end via scoping.
- **Mentions** are collected from the entire statement subtree: nested blocks,
  loop bodies, lambda bodies (capture-by-value happens at the statement
  containing the lambda literal), `{var}` interpolations (full brace content,
  verbatim — mirroring `interpolate_string`), input prompts, `\ var`, match
  patterns. The `Expr` walker is exhaustive (no `_` arm): a new expression
  variant fails compilation here until its mention rule is written.
- **Candidates**: region-level creations (assignment, destructuring, `<<`,
  `<<|`, `><`) plus a function's by-value parameters.
- **Poisoned (never freed)**: constants, hot names (`x°`/`°x`), `_`-prefixed
  names, output/mutable parameters (caller write-back), module-level bindings
  (module state write-back protocol, MM-2), and free variables of named
  functions used as first-class values (their bodies snapshot outer names at
  the point of use — `f = adder` / HOF operands / pipe callables).

### Runtime (tree-walker)

- Schedules are computed once: the top-level schedule in `execute()`, each
  function's in its `FunctionDecl` registration
  (`FunctionDef::Zymbol::auto_free`), against the same program-wide exclusion
  set. `execute_body_scheduled` applies them after each statement, skipping
  while control flow is pending (frame/loop teardown owns those paths).
- Destroyed names go to `auto_dead_variables` — frame-local (in
  `SavedCallState`, per the MM-3 lesson) and separate from `\`'s
  `dead_variables`: reaching one raises
  `internal: use after auto-destruction … please report it` instead of the
  user-facing lifetime error. String interpolation checks it too (a missing
  interpolation variable otherwise degrades silently to literal `{var}`).
  Reassignment resurrects, exactly like `\`.
- Measured effect: two sequential 30 MB strings peak at ~64 MB instead of
  ~94 MB (value freed before the second one is built).

### Runtime (VM)

The compiler runs the same analysis per region (main chunk, each function
body — with each module's own exclusion set during `compile_import`) and emits
`LoadUnit` on the variable's register after its last-use statement.

> **Known limitation (VM)**: expression *temporaries* may retain a value until
> their register is overwritten, so the VM's peak-memory win is currently
> smaller than the tree-walker's. Freeing temporaries needs its own lifetime
> tracking — future work; correctness is unaffected.

### Invisibility evidence

At the commit that introduced auto-free: 847 unit tests (12 analyzer + 2 interpreter
integration), 519/519 TW/VM parity, 503/503 golden files, 89/89 GUIDE examples,
formatter property harness clean, benchmark gate 14/14 (no regressions; several
benchmarks improve from lower allocator pressure).

Re-measured at the v0.0.8 release (2026-08-01), still with no auto-free-attributable
failure: 936 unit tests, 544/544 TW/VM parity, 523/525 golden (two stale fixtures —
`IMPL_V008.md` § E.1), formatter property 600 PASS / 0 FAIL, benchmark gate 14/14.

Re-measured on the `v0.0.9` branch (2026-09-07), same conclusion and now on the corpus
that moved to `zyquality/`: **1026 unit tests**, 660/666 TW/VM consensus with **0
diverging**, goldens **0 stale**, formatter property **710 PASS / 0 FAIL**, benchmark
gate **16/16**, `zyq suite` **all gates pass**. The two auto-free debts of `IMPL_V008.md`
§ B are still open and still undecided — they are tracked in `interpreter/ROADMAP.md`
§ Known Gaps, and neither is a regression.
